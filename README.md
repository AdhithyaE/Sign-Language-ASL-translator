# sign-translator
A project at it's initial stage that could potentially help millions belonging to the speech impaired community.

The major functions this system should perform is:
1. Sign Language to Text Conversion
Here, the input is a series of images extracted from a video sequence.
These images are processed, features are extracted from it, and these
features are used to classify it under a certain word/letter.
2. Sign Dictionary

To few phrases available for conversion and provide either a short de-
scription of how the sign is obtained or shot video clip of it in action.

3. Adding new signs

This functionality is performed by the administrator only. This func-
tionality consists of acquiring the images for the new sign, training the

system to recognize the sign, and testing whether the sign is being rec-
ognized by the system while making sure it doesnt hinder the detection

of previously learned signs.
